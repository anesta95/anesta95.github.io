The micromort is one of the most widely-cited measurements that points to exactly how risky any certain activity might be.
Concieved by former Stanford professor [Ronald Howard](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ronald-howard), the metric 
provides a comparable number for any potentially dangerous activity that quantifies how lethal said action might be. Basically,
one micromort is equivalent to about a 1 in 1 million chance of death when engaging in an actions ranging from ones traditionally
thought of as risky such as scuba diving and skydiving, to the more mundane such as walking and driving. 

I often think of micromorts when biking around my home in Washington, DC either for leisure or, prior to Covid-19, to commute to work.
According to Howard, traveling just 10 miles by bicycle is associated with [an increase of one micromort](https://archive.is/20120714164305/http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/sdrmda61w/session10b/slides/sld031.htm). 
It might not sound like a lot, but biking is one of the riskiest forms of travel in the US with only the one micromore associate with traveling [6 miles in a motorcycle](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article5696688.ece) being more perilous.

As I've written about in a previous post, the Vision Zero initative is a movement to 
not accept as due course any traffic-related deaths and injuries, including cyclists. Starting in Sweden, governments all across the world have been 
enacting concerted policies in an effort to achieve a transportation infrastrture that is not conducive to any dangerous or potentially lethal situations
for any method of commuting. In DC, the city government adapted Vision Zero [in 2014](https://www.dcvisionzero.com/) and has a goal of zero
traffic fatalities by 2024. To that end, DC has adopted [dual-turn lanes](https://ddot.dc.gov/page/intersections-dual-turn-lanes) at potentially
[high-risk](https://ddot.dc.gov/node/1309236) intersections and has also installed new protected bike lanes on [14th street by Columbia Heights](https://ddot.dc.gov/release/ddot-begins-construction-14th-street-nw-bus-lane-improvement-project) and the [Irving Street exchange over North Capital street](https://parkviewdc.com/2020/05/04/update-on-the-irving-kenyon-crosstown-protect-bike-lane-project/).

That being said, according to data from the [Open Data DC portal](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crashes-in-dc), there have been at least 11 fatal bike crashes in the District in the last 10 years. 
Many times I go cycling around the DC area, I'll see [ghost bikes](http://ghostbikes.org/) that have been painted white to mark the location of where a cyclist was killed in a crash. 

The memorials are harrowing reminders that there is a real cost to not only the dangerous behavior of drivers in the area, but also the lack of responsible and 
humane transit design that takes into account the safety of commuters of all methods and means. To that end I've made the below map with the location, date, ward, and story behind of each crash.
